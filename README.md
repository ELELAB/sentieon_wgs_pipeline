# Germline WGS Variant Calling pipeline
Germline Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) variant calling workflow with [SentieonÂ®](https://www.sentieon.com) (DNAseq 202010.02) for paired-end sequencing data in Danish HPC Computerome2. Wrapper and submission script-generator are included to facilitate the process.
   
See Sentieon's [DNAseq manual](https://support.sentieon.com/versions/202010.02/manual/DNAseq_usage/dnaseq/) and [Argument Correspondence application note](https://support.sentieon.com/appnotes/arguments/) for information on how parameters in the Sentieon tools correspond to parameters in the GATK.

## Wrapper    
To submitt a sample for analysis in Computerome2, `sentieon_wrapper_v2.sh` is used. This script combines all the neccesary to submit the WGS variant calling analysis of a sample/set of samples to the queuing system of Computerome2 HPC. It uses `submit.py` to generate and submit a PBS submission script (qsub) that runs the WGS pipeline script `sentieon_WGS_froz38.sh`  on the sample/s of interest.  
  
Usage: `sentieon_wrapper_v2 -[options] [absolute path to R1.fq file/list]`   
Arguments:
| Argument | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| file/list  | a FASTQ file or a list of such files  |  

Options:

| Option  | Abreviation | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| --commit | -c  | committed run (default is dry)  |  
| --germline | -g  | germline (WGS) sample   |  
| --help | -h  | prints this message  |  
| --version | -v  | prints version and date   |  


Notes:  
	- the sample type (germline) must be specified with  '-g' 
	- at least one input file or list must be given  
	- a file has to have a name in the form `/<absolut_path>/<name>.R1.fq.gz` [(iCOPE nomenclature convention)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V22gvaMExWaHE1wM-0cihxBygQk6KlK9hZWnRoFvh8Y/edit#heading=h.rq7vebkfu0au)  
	- a list has to contain FQ files with names as above  

Example:  
`sentieon_wrapper_v2 -g -c [absolute path]R1.fq.gz`  
The sample is now queued in the job system (double check with qstat command) and should be analysed in 4-8 hours.
    
### submit.py  
General job-submission-script generator for Computerome2. It takes as argument the script to be run on HPC cluster and generates and submits the corresponding `.qsub` file to the queuing system. `sentieon_wrapper_v2` internally uses `submit.py` to generate submission scripts to run the samples of interest with `sentieon_WGS_froz38.sh`.   

Usage: `submit.py  script [-h] [-n NAME] [-no-nr] [-minutes MINUTES] [-hours HOURS]`  
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;`[-mem MEMORY] [-dir WORKDIR] [-py2] [-w WAIT_FOR] [-T] [-R]`  
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;`[-a ARRAY] [-max_jobs MAX_JOBS] [--verbose] [-np NPROC][-test] [-move]`

Positional arguments:   
| Argument | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| script | A string indicating the code to run (sentieon_WGS_froz38.sh).   |  

Optional arguments:  

| Option  | Abreviation | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| --help | -h  | Show this help message and exit  |
| --name | -n  | Name of the submission job. Default is a unique number after 'icope'.  |
| --no-numbering  | -no-nr  | Disable addinga number after the name in filenames to avoid overwriting files.  |
| --minutes  | -minutes  | Wall-time minutes. Default is 0. If no walltime is provided, then is 30.  |
| --hours  | -hours  | Wall-time hours. Default is 10. |
| --memory  | -mem  | Memory in gb. Default is 150.  |
| --workdir | -dir  | The submission files are saved here. Relative filenames in command is relative to this. Default is current directory. |
| --python2  | -py2  | A flag set if we want to run the code with python2.  |
| --wait  | -w  | Used to wait for a given job to finish successfully. Insert the job number.  |
| --tunnel  | -T  | Flag set to include opening and closing tunnel for contacting Sentieon license. Default name are sentieon[start/stop]2.sh located in your $HOME |
| --reserve  | -R  | Use this flag to submit job to our own reserves nodes  |
| --array  | -a  | Used to create job array, the job number will be $PBS_ARRAYID. Insert numbers to run eg. 608-631.  |
| --max_jobs  | -max_jobs  | Choose maximum number of jobs to run at a time from this call. This setting is  only relevant for array jobs. If more array jobs are started than this number,some of them will wait to run.  |
| --verbose  | -verbose  | Add to execute set -xv and more information.  |
| --nproc  | -np  | Number of processors to use. Default is 38  |
| --move-outfile  | --move  | When running the pipeline, enable moving the output files to the sample folder generated by the scirpt.   |


Default behaviour when using `sentieon_wrapper_v2 -g -c [absolute path]R1.fq.gz`:  
`submit.py "sentieon_WGS_froz38.sh SAMPLE_NAME.R1.fq.gz 38" -n SAMPLE_NAME -np 38 -move --tunnel | tee -a sentieon_wrapper.SAMPLE_NAME.log`  

### sentieon_WGS_froz38.sh  
Script to run Sentieons DNAseq pipeline on a germline paired-end WGS sample with reference Human Genome build 38. Takes as input the R1.fq file and the number of available computing cores to output its corresponding BAM+RecalibrationTable as well as the VCF containing the genetic variants of the sample. Quality metrics and figures are also outputed in the results folder.       
Usage: `sentieon_WGS.froz38.sh SAMPLE_NAME.R1.fq.gz [n of cores]`
